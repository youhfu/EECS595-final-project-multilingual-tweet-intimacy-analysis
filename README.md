# EECS595-final-project-multilingual-tweet-intimacy-analysis

This is the project of EECS 595. It is actually the Task 9 of SemEval competition in 2023

We use GreatLake to run source code efficiently. It takes 20 to 30 minutes to run a model. The bash files we submitted to GreatLake are in bash_file folder.

We use four LLMs in this project: mDistillBert, mDeBerta, XLM-R, XLM-T. To run the models, you need install transformer package and Pytorch in your environment in advance.
